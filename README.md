I am a MAPSS student with a concentration of psychology. Specifically, I am interested in visual perception and affective neuroscience. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Denver where I was involved in a number of psychology research. Here is a taste of what I am interested in:

* Perceptual biases in emotion categorization when facing crowds
    * How do people perceive emotions when they see multiple faces?
* The effect of chromatic context on emotion perception
    * Does colored background induce a bias in people's judgement during an emotion categorization task?
    * How can we use this biase, if it exists, to facilitate our emotion regulation process?
* Visual ambiguity in binocular rivalry
    * What will we see if our two eyes receive different images?
